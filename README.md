A mod that allows enchants go to on tinkers weapons via anviling, coded very poorly with the help of Gemini (google's ai). 
made for 1.19.2

Issues:
- currently doesnt have any glint, but hopefully this can be fixed (tried to fix it without looking at tconstruct's source code but was unsuccessful)
- doesnt detect the mod apotheosis's max level properly (combining enchants like sharpness 5 + sharpness 5 should be sharpness 6)
